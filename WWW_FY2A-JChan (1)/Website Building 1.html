    <h1> Hearthstone Info</h1>
    
    <p> Hearthstone is a well known game that has been released for more than 6 years. It still updates to this date and has given out a lot of content to the players who enjoy this game. Today I am going to explain to you the major concepts of Hearthstone itself and how they work. </p>
    
    <h2> How Hearthstone works </h2>
   
        <p> Hearthstone is a traditional card game that  is very well known from Blizard. For Hearthstone, the game's mechanics is mainly a turn-based card game where players use a hero to combat against other players. The motive is to use your hero and reduce the enemy player to 0 health. You do this by using "minions" to help reduce down health. The first person to do so wins. </p> <img src="https://pngimage.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/logo-hearthstone-png-6.png">
        
     <h2> Mana </h2>
    <p> Mana Crystals are crystals on your bottom right screen(or your right hand side) for you to play out your cards

     It will automaticly refilled after every single turn. However, when you begin the game, you will only start with 1 mana crystal, and will gradually gain 1 mana crystal as each turn goes by. Mana Crystals can get destroyed by special effects as well. </p>
       
    <h2> Minions </h2>   
    <p> Minions are creatures that you use to tear down the enemy's health and fight for your hero. 
        Basically these creatures has health and attack. Their attack is displayed on the left as a sword and their health displayed on the right as a blood drop.  <a href="https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com"> Visit this website for more info.</a>

    <br><br> As listed in the picture, the River Crocolisk has about 2 attack and 3 health. These minions would be put on the battlefield so that they would attack the enemy hero as turns go on. </p>

            

    <h2> Spells </h2>
        <p> Spells are unique card that have an effect or an ability that gets triggered. It is a one time effect only and spells can produce crazy effects. <a href="https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Spell"> Visit this Website for more info.</a>
