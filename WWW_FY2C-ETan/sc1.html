  <h1>The Case of the Stolen Billionaire</h1>
   <h2>A Play By Ethan Tan</h2>
    <p>Summary: A Villain from the distant future travels 100 years back in time to escape and kidnaps a Billionaire and demands a 50 Billion Dollar Ransom for his release. However, when he receives the money, he does not release him and taunts to kill him for more money until he gets all of his money and becomes the richest man in the world. The Billionaire pleads for mercy but the Villain takes no notice of him. Suddenly, the Hero arrives and rescues him, taking the villainâ€™s blaster. When the villain runs after him, the hero shoots him.
