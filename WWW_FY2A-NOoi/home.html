            <h1>One night in 2009, we witnessed a single pallet of fresh, perfectly edible bread headed to the bin. Instead of letting this good food go to waste, we rescued and donated it to a local crisis shelter. This evolved into a quest to find out what happened to other good food when it was no longer wanted.
            </h1>
            <h1>There were signs of encouragement: individual bakeries sharing surplus, charities picking up leftovers from wet markets at closing time. But what was missing was something of scale â€“ a link between companies with quality surplus, and charities with need. This is the gap Feeding Hong Kong fills.</h1>
            
            <h1>We collect surplus stock from food companies, sort and store it, and redistribute it to multiple charities across the city. This approach allows us to make efficient use of the established distribution channels, and serve a broad and diverse group of people.</h1>
            
            <h1>We collect high quality surplus food from farms, manufacturers, distributors and retailers, and redistribute it to local registered charities. Donating your surplus to feed people, not landfills, is cost and time effective, environmentally friendly and benefits the community.</h1>
            
            <p class="lead">Did you know that lots and lots of unneeded yet fresh,  perfectly fine food goes to waste everyday? How such good food goes to waste an d landfills instead of places where it is needed? Like the poor in Hong Kong that can't afford to buy for themselves? And yes, there are charities across The country that are making efforts in order to supply the poor with much needed food.  But sometimes they may not have enough supplies to do so.  Luckily Feed Hong Kong is here to fix all that. And how you ask? Well, Feed Hong Kong's purpose is to reduce food waste by collecting surplus(food that is not needed) that was intended to go to landfills to other charities across Hong Kong. This not only helps the other charities but also reduces food waste because the supposedly "unneeded" food is now being sent to a place where it IS needed.</p>
