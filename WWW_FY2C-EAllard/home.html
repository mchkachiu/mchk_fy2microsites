            <h1>For Secondary Students</h1>
            <p class="lead">No matter which school, there will always be students who have no motivation to do their homework. They may lose focus, motivation or get distracted. This website may no completely get rid of the habit, but it will definitely help stop or decrease many of the habits. When students do not complete their homework, even if it is optional, they will start to fall behind in school. If a student doesn't do their homework, their grades will probably start to drop. When many parents see this they will probably send them to tuition. These classes often happen after school, so it will eat into their sleeping times. Students need to sleep in order to actually learn stuff. </p>

                </div>
                <p2>Having a timetable. Having a timetable is a really good idea to have to help you organize your homework and after school activities. It'll help you keep your work organised and you won't forget about it. </p2>

                    Tip 2:
                </div>
                <p2>Studying in study-buddy groups. Having study-buddy groups are great for students if they have lots to catch up on. Study-buddy groups allow students to have a social life, understand time management and catch up on their studying. </p2>
                <div class="col-md-4">
                    Tip 3:
                </div>
                <p2>Getting lots of sleep! Sleeping helps you to clear out your mind and get rid of information that you no longer need. This can help you refresh and clear out your mind and get you prepared for the next day. Also, sleeping is also a way to relax and chill. </p2>

        <h1>What can you do to motivate yourself into doing these?</h1>
        <p2>You could have treats at the end of every month to keep you on track with your homework and keeping a timetable and updating it frequently. Teachers and parents could get involved in this too.  Merits are a great way to be rewarded for having and keeping a good time table. You could turn this into a competitive game and you could have a system at home with your siblings and whoever has kept their timetable and their homework system well, could get a reward. </p2>
