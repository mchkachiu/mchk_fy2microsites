844 million people lack basic drinking water access

The United Nations recognizes the importance of addressing the global water crisis each year on World Water Day, March 22.

Women and children are worst affected children because they are more sensitive of dirty water and women because they often have to carry water for 3.7 miles each day.
Less than 1 percent of the Earth's water is fit for consumption.

"CHILDREN OF A CULTURE BORN IN A WATER-RICH ENVIRONMENT, WE HAVE NEVER REALLY LEARNED HOW IMPORTANT WATER IS TO US. WE UNDERSTAND IT, BUT WE DO NOT RESPECT IT."

            <h1>Question & Answer</h1>
            <p class="lead"> Why is Water Scarcity becoming serious?
Water shortages may be caused by climate change, such as altered weather patterns including droughts or floods, increased pollution, and increased human demand and overuse of water. Water covers 70% of our planet, and it is easy to think that it will always be plentiful. Only 3% of the world’s water is fresh water, and two-thirds of that is tucked away in frozen glaciers or otherwise unavailable for our use.
As a result, some 1.1 billion people worldwide lack access to water, and a total of 2.7 billion find water scarce for at least one month of the year. People are getting lack of access to water and people are turning sick because the water is not clean.

2.  What are the effects of Water Scarcity?

The effects of water scarcity can be grouped into these 4 broad areas— Health, Hunger, Education, and Poverty. Less water also means sewage does not flow, and mosquitoes are other insects breed on still (stagnant) dirty water. The result is deadly malaria and other infections. Water shortages directly contribute to lower crop yields and the death of livestock, which can quickly lead to food shortages.

3. How can we fix water Scarcity?

Recycle Water: There are plenty of technologies out there that allow you to recycle rainwater and other water that you may be using in your home. Consider learning about how you can recycle water. Not only does it help to prevent scarcity, but it can save you some money as well.

Improve Sewage Systems: Clean drinking water starts with a good sewage system. Without proper sanitation, the water in an area becomes ridden with disease and any number of other problems. By improving the sewage systems in these areas, we can prevent water scarcity from becoming any worse.

Support Clean Water Initiatives: There are organizations located all over the world that are looking to bring clean water to areas that don’t have it. Consider donating to these organizations, either with your time, your skills, or your finances (whichever you can afford to give to them).

Improve Practices Related to Farming: Farming and irrigation are often a huge culprit when it comes to water scarcity. Because of that, we need to improve practices so that we don’t use as much water and those who are using water are using it to its fullest potential. Technology also needs to advance in this manner.
4. Who causes Water Scarcity?

Human activity is a major cause of water scarcity due to the use of fossil fuels that alter climate and weather activity, as well as the rapid increase in global population consuming more water. In order to provide for a growing population, dams and irrigation systems are built to supply fresh water to remote areas. As humans continue to pump more carbon dioxide and other greenhouse, water is getting tighter and tighter for certain countries/cities. By 2025, two-thirds of the world's population may face water shortages.

            <h1 What parts of the world is most affected?</h1>
            <p class="lead">
 This graphic shows the amount of water withdrawal as a percentage of the total available supply, at the national level in 1995 and in 2025 (projected amounts). Overall, the percentages are expected to rise substantially by 2025. This resource also includes a graphic showing the number of people suffering from water stress and water scarcity worldwide in 1995, compared to projected rates for the year 2050. As the population continues to rise, the number of people affected by water stress and water scarcity is expected to rise sharply.

            <h1 What are people doing to fix water scarcity?</h1>
            <p class="lead">
 1. We can conserve water by using more efficient appliances and by managing our daily usage better

2. We need to fundamentally re think agriculture by growing crops that use less water by cutting down on life struck farming and using techniques like drip irrigation to maximize efficiency.

3. We can conserve new sources of growing water.

4. Protecting our rivers and lakes could also help.

            <h1 Why is Water scarcity such a major problem?</h1>
            <p class="lead">
When waters run dry, people can't get enough to drink, wash, or feed crops, and economic decline may occur. In addition, inadequate sanitation—a problem for 2.4 billion people can lead to deadly diarrheal diseases, including cholera and typhoid fever, and other water-borne illnesses.

Water scarcity can mean scarcity in availability due to physical shortage, or scarcity in access due to the failure of institutions to ensure a regular supply or due to a lack of adequate infrastructure. Water scarcity already affects every continent.
