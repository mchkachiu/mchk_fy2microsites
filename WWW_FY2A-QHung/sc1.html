    <h1>Footballx1 World-Extended Page-MESSI V RONALDO</h1>
    <h2>Rivalry-Players</h2>
    <h3>Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi</h3>
    <p>Skills-Messi only does body feint, chips, and sudden acceleration, while ronaldo knows stepovers, outside foot, marsille turn, cruyff turn, and more.</p>
    <p>Shooting-Messi is not able to to cannonball but can only chip the ball or to swift but soft top-ins. Ronaldo's shots are powerfull, always go in the acute angles, do knucleballs, and can curve the ball like beckham(but beckham is still a bit better at this)</p>
    <p>THAT IS WHY RONALDO IS BETTER</p>
