                    Your brain likes a little bit of information at a time, it doesn't like big chunks of information. When your brain sees information divided into certain compartments, your brain feels motivated and less stressed. It also helps free up your brain. It stops your brain from doing unnecessary thinking. When you are trying to remember something, there are three parts of your brain that work. Working memory, short term memory and long term memory. If you don't have a place to write stuff down, your brain goes into stress mode because it's trying to hold onto all of the information. When your brain is stressed, your body immediately releases a chemical that blocks the learning pathway. If you do have an area to write stuff down, your brain focuses on the learning rather than the remembering. This erases your stress level.

                    1. Have one space at home where you always do your studying. This is because your brain likes to be in one area. If you are all over the place, your brain will find it hard to focus. This must be a quiet area with a desk. 
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4">
                    2. Get enough sleep. Your brain cannot work without sleep therefore you can't study or do your school work. If you do so, your brain will go into overload and not know what to do. This can affect your everyday life.

            <div class="col-md-4">
                    3. Study buddy groups. It has to be with people you can study with. If it's with your best friend, you'll just start talking therefore you won't be focused. This helps because people often like to be accompanied.
